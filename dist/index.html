    <p id= "img-caption"> So if you love dogs like we do, please consider adopting one. </p>
    <p> One of the pet owners who adopted one of the Dogs here said this about her new pet...<br> </br><i>"Despite all she’s been through, Emma is finally getting a chance to show just how loving she really is. She craves any kind of affection, will stick to her foster like glue and gives wonderful little kisses,”</i> David said. <i> “She is very special and we feel lucky to have been able to rescue her.”</p></i>

          One of the largest challenges facing animal welfare organizations today is the sheer number of animals in need of assistance.<br> Every year, approximately 6.5 million companion animals arrive at one of the community animal shelters nationwide.</b> </br> </p>
    
<p> We Rescue Stray Cats as well. Cats are the most Loving Pets to have they do the following:
